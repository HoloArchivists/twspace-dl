Enter cmd in the text bar as shown above and press enter

Once the cmd window is open, enter the location of the file (e.g. `C:\Users\John\Desktop\twspace-dl.exe`), followed by `-i` 
and the URL of the space you want to download (e.g. `https://twitter.com/i/space/DeadB33F`)

Such that the result looks somewhat like this 
```
C:\Users\John\Desktop\twspace-dl.exe -i https://twitter.com/i/space/DeadB33F
```

This should mostly work for ongoing and recorded space
